### Pong Game üè∏

This repository contains the files for a Pong game I made back when I was beginning to get into Unity. Looking back at it, the code isn't that good (far too verbose), but it was a step in the right direction regardless. It helped foster my love for game development and allowed me to practice skills I could use in UVA's Student Game Developer Club.

Here is a link to a video of the game in action:
